This is a personal site created to gather my thoughts on intersecting knowledge domains and maintain my familiarity with the frameworks and technologies that I work with.

Planned writing topics include machine learning, software development, evolutionary biology, and government.

The site will initially be created with Next and Typescript for practice purposes but will later be branched and migrated to Astro because I believe it to be a better fit for this project. However, the Next branch will remain in the case that I decide to build a different highly interactive project into this site.
